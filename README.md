# P4wnP1-A.L.O.A.-Payloads

Payloads I use on my P4wnP1 A.L.O.A.

All of my payloads use the **US** keyboard layout

### *How to use my payloads*

* HID scripts should be placed in `/usr/local/P4wnP1/HIDScripts` or you can just copy and paste them into the HIDScripts section of the web editor

* Bash scripts should be placed in `/usr/local/P4wnP1/scripts`
   Bash scripts can be run with a trigger and can be configured on the trigger actions tab of the web editor

* If you need to install some package on the pi that requires internet access please see [this](https://youtu.be/QEWaIoal5qU) video. 

   *Note this video is not made by me.* After doing the instructions on this video the IP of P4wnP1 is `172.16.0.1:8000`
